# CCDCLogger

A password and event logger for use during CCDC to help with team communication.

Concept: 
```
Alright, so for the logger for during the competition I was thinking about putting together a Java CLI
Java so the Windows guys can use it too
Basically I'm thinking a prompt that says like, press 1 to log user password change, 2 for service password, etc
The logger sends a message to our IRC channel
And automatically saves the password to our password manager that I'm going to find before I start writing
Of course, the script can also retrieve passwords
Give indicators of who did what on what machine
I'll likely put it on GitHub once I get started
Once it's ready, we can just pack up a JAR and pass it around
```
